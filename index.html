            <p><b>This Demo simply displays how my LIRI-bot-app works.</b></p>
            <p>Firstly i am using a bandsintown API and parameters to get information on artists and thier upcoming shows.</p>
            <p> Secondly i am using a omdb API to get information of movies searched for.</p>
            <p>Thirdly i am using a spotify ID and SECRET to also get information from various songs of different artist with the songs title.</p>
            <p>Lastly is dominating CLI with jQuery and also my dependencies like axios, moment and fs.</p> 
            <p>Kindly switch to full screen to get a better view of my awesome app.</p>

            <p>Node.js was used along with NPM (Node Package Manager) libraries in order to accomplish the tasks.</p>
            <p>.env and the .gitignore file was used to keep scecrets of my API key so they are not published on my github repository</p>
            <p>AXIOS was used to get specified data fro queryURL, while MOMENT was used to set data actual date and time. FILE SYSTEM was used to get and append response to the log.txt file. All three of this are known as dependencies.</p>
            <p>NPM (Node Package Manager) holds all dependencies located in the package.jason file, while the NODE_MODULES are gotten from the AXIOS initial installation.</p>
